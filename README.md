- **Choose and justify a work methodology that is ideal for the planning and execution of the project.** Scrum is ideal for the planning and execution of the project due to its iterative approach, emphasis on customer collaboration, adaptability to changing requirements, and focus on delivering value incrementally. With Scrum, the project can be broken down into manageable iterations (sprints), allowing for quick feedback, continuous improvement, and alignment with customer needs. Scrum promotes transparency, communication, and cross-functional teamwork, enabling effective risk management and timely delivery of valuable software increments. Overall, Scrum provides the framework needed to navigate the complexities of the project while ensuring flexibility and customer satisfaction.

- **Reflection** This project has been an invaluable opportunity to translate theoretical knowledge into practical skills. By creating a diverse range of diagrams, including requirements, class, and activity diagrams, I gained hands-on experience in software design and planning. Implementing the Scrum methodology reinforced the significance of adaptability and collaboration in project management. Moreover, developing the database schema deepened my understanding of data modeling and database management. This experience has not only solidified my grasp of fundamental concepts but also equipped me with the confidence and skills necessary for future endeavors in software development.
